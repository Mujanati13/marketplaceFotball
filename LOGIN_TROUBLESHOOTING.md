1. **Android Manifest Permissions:**
   - Added `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permissions
   - Added `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` for HTTPS compatibility
   - Added network security configuration

2. **Network Security Config:**
   - Created `/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
   - Allows traffic to `footbalmarketplace.albech.me`
   - Configured trust anchors for system and user certificates

3. **HTTP Client SSL Configuration:**

   - Configured HTTP client to handle HTTPS properly

4. **API Response Parsing:**
   - Fixed AuthResponse to handle multiple token field formats
   - Added support for `accessToken`, `access_token`, and `token` fields
   - Enhanced error logging with detailed request/response information

### üêõ **Debugging Steps:**

If login still fails after installing the APK:

1. **Check Credentials:**
   - Verify email and password are correct
   - Try with known working credentials (admin user)

2. **Network Connection:**
   - Ensure device has internet connection
   - Try accessing https://footbalmarketplace.albech.me in browser

3. **Server Status:**
   - Verify the server is running and accessible
   - Check server logs for incoming requests

4. **Enable Debug Logging:**
   - If you have access to device logs, use:
     ```bash
     adb logcat | grep -i flutter
     ```

### üîç **Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **"Invalid credentials" error:**
   - Double-check email/password formatting
   - Ensure no extra spaces in input fields

2. **Network timeout:**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify server is accessible from device network

3. **Certificate errors:**
   - The SSL configuration should handle this automatically
   - If issues persist, check if the server certificate is valid

4. **Response parsing errors:**
   - The updated AuthResponse model handles multiple field formats
   - Server returns: `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user }`

### üì± **Testing Credentials:**
Try logging in with admin credentials:
- **Email:** `admin@footballmarketplace.com`  
- **Password:** `Admin123!`

### üöÄ **Next Steps:**
1. Install the new APK: `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`
2. Test login functionality
3. If issues persist, share any error messages you see
4. Consider testing on different network (WiFi vs Mobile data)
